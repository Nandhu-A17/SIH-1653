## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Concept:
A web-based platform where selectors (recruiters, examiners, or reviewers) can interact with applicants (job seekers, students, or candidates) in a simulated environment.

Potential Use Cases:
Hiring & Recruitment Simulation:

Simulates interviews, skill assessments, and real-world job scenarios.
AI-driven responses for applicants based on their qualifications.
Selectors can evaluate decision-making, communication, and technical skills.
University Admission Simulations:

Students go through a mock admission process.
AI-based assessment of essays, interviews, and academic performance.
Universities can test different selection criteria for efficiency.
Military or Government Selection Training:

Simulated selection exams for armed forces, police, or government roles.
Real-time problem-solving tasks for applicants.
AI-based evaluation of stress handling and decision-making.
Gamified Selection Process:

An interactive game-like approach for applicants to showcase skills.
Decision trees, puzzles, and scenario-based assessments.
Startup Investment Simulation:

Simulated startup pitch competitions.
Investors (selectors) choose the best applicants (entrepreneurs).
AI-powered feedback on investment decisions.

Proposed Solution:
A cloud-based web application where selectors (recruiters, assessors) can interact with applicants (job seekers, students, candidates) in a simulated environment. The platform will use AI and automation to evaluate responses, simulate real-world decision-making scenarios, and generate analytics.

Key Features:
User Roles:

Applicants: Participate in simulations, answer scenario-based questions, and complete assessments.
Selectors: Set up simulations, define assessment criteria, and evaluate applicants.
Admin: Manages users, permissions, and system settings.
Simulation Engine:

Dynamic scenario generation based on industry/domain.
AI-driven responses to simulate real-world interviews/tests.
Time-bound decision-making tasks.
AI-Powered Assessment:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated scoring of written responses.
AI-powered interview analysis (facial expression, speech patterns).
Gamification with scenario-based decision trees.
Data Analytics & Reporting:

Performance insights for selectors.
AI-based recommendations for applicant selection.
Trend analysis across different applicants.

Implementation Phases:
Planning: Define objectives, target audience, and key features. Gather requirements  from stakeholders.
